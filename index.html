      <h1>Burj Khalifa Tower- Dubaiüòç</h1>
      <p>
        The Burj Khalifa (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in
        2010) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is known for
        being the world's tallest building. With a total height of 829.8 m
        (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding
        antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire[2]) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj
        Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since
        its topping out in 2009, supplanting Taipei 101, the previous holder of
        that status.

      <p>
        Merdeka 118, formerly known as Warisan Merdeka Tower, KL 118 and PNB
        118, is a 118-story megatall skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At
        678.9 m (2,227 ft) tall, it is the second-tallest structure and the
        second-tallest building in the world, behind the Burj Khalifa at 828 m
        (2,717 ft). The building's name, Merdeka (which literally means
        "independence"), is inspired by its proximity to Stadium Merdeka.[10]
        The spire of the building was completed in October 2021, which marked
        its final height of 678.9 m (2,227 ft) above ground and 717.6 m (2,354
        ft) above sea level.

        m.[11] It had the world's second-fastest elevators at a top speed of

        surpassed by the Guangzhou CTF Finance Center, with its top speed of 21
        meters per second (76 km/h; 47 mph).[14] Designed by international
        design firm Gensler and owned by the Shanghai Municipal Government.
